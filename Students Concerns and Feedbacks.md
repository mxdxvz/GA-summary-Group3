Students Concerns and Feedbacks

1. Academic Concerns 
SRA Retention Policy Issues
Students sometimes fail to complete SRA within the 2 year requirement
Reminders for 2nd-year students to finish SRA early to avoid academic delay

2. Student Engagement and participation
CS students have low involvement and "nonchalant" attitude during events or activities
Officers want to encourage more active participation in school events, orgs
Some students hesitant to join competition/events

3. Organizational & Resource Concerns
Multiple studebts orgs now exist (not just TACTICS)
Students may not be aware of available engagment such as CS Guild space with ACW
Students need for more awareness about startup opportunities like Magis TBI

4. Academic Support & Mentoring
Students appreciate flexible schedules and support systems
Students may need mutual help in academics thats why they have Peer Prep Fridays mentoring program 
Mentees open to all year levels and mentors ideally 3rd to 4th years with subject mastery.

They have mixed motivations for studying like some stuents love the course, others are only continuing for financial reasons and that impacts engagement.
